## System Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Main Application**: `main.py` serves as the entry point, setting up the Telegram bot application with handlers and job scheduling
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration in `config.py` with environment variables and constants
- **Data Layer**: JSON-based file storage system managed through `database.py`
- **Handler Layer**: Modular handlers for different bot functionalities in the `handlers/` directory
- **Utility Functions**: Common functions and decorators in `utils.py`

## Key Components

### 1. Bot Core (`main.py`)
- Telegram bot application setup using python-telegram-bot library
- Handler registration for commands, messages, and callbacks
- Auto-deletion job scheduling for message cleanup
- Chat member update handling for channel management

### 2. Configuration (`config.py`)
- Bot token and username configuration
- Owner ID and admin settings
- Category and language definitions for movies
- Ad page URL configuration
- Message templates for movie posts
- Conversation timeout settings

### 3. Database Layer (`database.py`)
- JSON file-based storage system
- Separate files for users, admins, movies, channels, requests, and tokens
- CRUD operations for all entities
- Data initialization and file management

### 4. Handler Modules
- **Start Handler**: Welcome messages, user registration, deep link processing
- **Movie Handlers**: Search functionality, category browsing, movie details
- **Conversation Handlers**: Multi-step conversations for adding movies

- **Owner Handlers**: Admin management, channel management (owner-only features)

### 5. Utility Functions (`utils.py`)
- Role-based access control decorator (`@restricted`)

4. Users get notified when requests are fulfilled

### File Download Flow
1. User clicks download button
2. Bot generates secure token and ad page link
3. User visits ad page and gets redirected back with token
4. Bot validates token and sends file
